Geometry 2D
~~~~~~~~~

There is an object included set of methods for processing 2D
geometrical figures. The most of implemented methods based on
the **shapely** library.


.. autoclass:: gefest.core.geometry.geometry_2D.Geometry2D
   :members:

Validation
~~~~~~~~~

There is one of the processing layer of optimization. 


.. automodule:: gefest.core.geom.validation
