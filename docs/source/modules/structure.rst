Structure
========

There is a description of structural elements that allow to create
geometrical objects. Any geometrical figure might be created via set of
3D ``Point`` objects, ``Polygon`` and ``Structure`` objects.  

class Point
~~~~~~~~~
.. autoclass:: gefest.core.structure.point.Point
   :members:
   :no-undoc-members:

class Polygon
~~~~~~~~~
.. autoclass:: gefest.core.structure.polygon.Polygon

class Structure
~~~~~~~~~
.. autoclass:: gefest.core.structure.structure.Structure
   :members:
   :no-undoc-members:
